**You can find this and more hand crafted quality overlays in the [rpie-ovl repository](https://github.com/udb23/rpie-ovl).** 
And if you want an easy way to install them, @meleu created a great dedicated script.
Perform these commands on your RetroPie:

```
cd
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/meleu/rpie-art
cd rpie-art
./rpie-art.sh
```


After launching `rpie-art.sh` script you just have to follow the instructions in the dialog boxes. Once you have the `rpi-art.sh`script, choose the **Update** option to get all the latest art in the repository.
